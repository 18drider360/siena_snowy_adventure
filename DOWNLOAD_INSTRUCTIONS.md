## Why the Security Warning?

The app isn't "code-signed" (which costs $99/year for developers). This is normal for indie games and small projects. The game is completely safe - it just plays music, shows graphics, and saves your scores!

## Troubleshooting

### Game won't open at all
- Make sure you extracted the zip file (don't try to run it from inside the zip)
- Try redownloading if the file is corrupted

### No sound
- Check your Mac's volume
- Check System Settings → Sound → make sure app isn't muted

### Can't connect to online leaderboard
