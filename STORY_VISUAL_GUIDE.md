## Notes for AI Image Generation

When generating images with AI (like Claude, DALL-E, Midjourney, etc.):

1. **Provide full scene description** from this guide
2. **Specify character details** (Siena's red scarf, Pedro's appearance)
3. **Mention lighting and atmosphere** for each scene
4. **Request cinematic, story-driven style** (not cartoony, but family-friendly)
5. **Keep top 140px in mind** for text overlay (less critical content there)
6. **Ensure emotional expressions** are clear and appropriate
7. **Maintain consistency** across images for characters
8. **Use this document** as reference for each scene's requirements

Example prompt format:
```
"Create a cinematic illustration for a story-driven platformer game.
Scene: [Scene Name from guide]
Description: [Full description from guide]
Style: Animated film quality, family-friendly, dramatic lighting
Characters: [Character details from guide]
Atmosphere: [Atmosphere from guide]
Technical: 1920x1080, leave top 140px less busy for text overlay"
```
